## Shiny Demo

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that takes interactivity to another level through interactive web applications, allowing users to interact with any aspect of your data and analysis. You can host them as standalone web apps or embed them within R Markdown documents or build dashboards. And the best part is...**you can do it all within R, no web development skills required!**

So, lets walk through the steps and build a quick shiny app! For this demo we are going to build off some of the data and interactive maps you made in the [Week 4 Geospatial Lesson 3](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-4-Geospatial/blob/master/spatial-viz.md). For example, we have a lot of species occurrence data with numerous variables. Based on various attributes, we could allow users to choose what they want to see on the map, such as which species, what type of observation they were, and the range of elevation species were found at.

*But first, a little background on how Shiny works.*

Shiny apps are contained in a single script called `app.R` . `app.R` has three components:

-   a user interface (ui) object, which controls the layout and appearance of your app

-   a server function, which contains the instructions needed to build your app

-   a call to `shinyApp()` which creates your web application based on your ui/server objects.

Let's create a new shiny app by going to File -\> New File -\> Shiny Web App. Call it something like 'shinyDemo', and save it in the project directory (which should be the default). Keep all other default settings.

This creates a new folder in your project directory with the same name you just gave the application, and within that folder is the `app.R` script which automatically gives an outline of our shiny app, with the `ui` and `server` objects and a call to `shinyApp()` at the end. **Since shiny apps are self contained within the `app.R` file**, at the top of the file define which libraries you need and read in your data. **`app.R` files assume the working directory is the directory the `app.R` file lives in**, so for this example the folder you just created is the working directory for `app.R`.

## Create your first shiny app

RStudio actually gives you a template app to work with by filling in the `ui` and `server` elements with some demo widgets and data. We can actually run this script and make our first shiny app!

To run this app, from the `app.R` script click the 'Run App' button in the upper right with the green arrow.

This is a very basic shiny app, but inspect the `app.R` script code and compare it to the application it creates. In the `ui` we create the layout (a sidebar panel and a main panel), specify the widgets and its settings (`sliderInput()`) and a placeholder for an output (`plotOutput()`). One of the most important things to notice is that each widget or output in the `ui` must be given an ID, which is the first argument in each function (e.g., the ID for `sliderInput()` is "bins", the ID for the `plotOutput()` is "distPlot").

These IDs are how you define what happens on the server side. When we look at this server code, we create the plot output by calling `output${insert ID name here}` and assign it some code to create the plot. Within this code chunk, we also see `input$bins`. This will return the value that the user has selected from the slider input and create the plot (in this case, changing the bin size of the plot).

## Create a shiny app for Colorado species occurrence data

Now that you've seen some of the fundamental structure of a shiny app, lets make our own using data from Week 4 Geospatial lesson.

First, load the shiny demo data (located in the data/ folder) and inspect the `occ` object. You should also read in the following libraries:

```{r}
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

load("data/shinyDemoData.RData")

occ
```

`occ` is an sf point object, and for each species occurrence point we have attributes for the species, year and month of observation, type of observation, and the elevation at that occurrence. We also loaded in the park boundary polygon for Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO) that we will add to the map as well. Let's use `tmap` to make an interactive map of all these layers. *Note: this is pulling from some of the code in the Week 4 Geospatial spatial-viz.Rmd lesson.*

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(occ) +
  tm_dots(
    col = "Species",
    size = 0.1,
    palette = "Dark2",
    title = "Species Occurrences",
    popup.vars = c("Record Type" = "basisOfRecord",
                   "Elevation (m)" = "elevation")
  ) +
  tm_shape(ROMO) +
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.7, title = "Rocky Mountain National Park")



```

The first thing we may notice is there are a lot of species occurrence points on this map. This is a good scenario to turn this into a shiny application to allow users to filter out these points on the map based on different attributes.

### Getting Started

Remember that the `app.R` runs assuming that the directory it is in is the working directory. To get the data for this demo shiny app, **find `shinyDemoData.RData` in the Week-6-Project-Explore repo (your current project directory) and copy it to the new shiny app folder you just created (so the same folder `app.R` is in).**

Now lets set up our app script by loading necessary libraries and data sets. Put this chunk of code at the top of `app.R` (under `library(shiny)`).

```{r}
#set up for the shiny app
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# read in data
load("shinyDemoData.RData")

# set tmap mode to interactive
tmap_mode("view")
```

### Define the `ui`

Lets keep the same layout as the template `app.R` script, with a fluid page with a title panel, followed by a sidebar layout with a main panel (our map) and a side panel (user inputs). You can learn more about different layout options [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html).

However, we do want to change the widgets and output. Delete the current `ui` and replace it with the following code (reading the comments to see what each widget is doing):

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  #App title
  titlePanel("Species of Colorado"),
  
  # Add some informational text using and HTML tag (i.e., a level 5 heading)
  h5(
    "In this app you can filter occurrences by species, type of observation, and elevation. You can also click on individual occurrences to view metadata."
  ),
  
  # Sidebar layout
  sidebarLayout(
    # Sidebar panel for widgets that users can interact with
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: select species shown on map
      checkboxGroupInput(
        inputId = "species",
        label = "Species",
        # these names should match that in the dataset, if they didn't you would use 'choiceNames' and 'choiceValues' like we do for the next widget
        choices = list("Elk", "Yellow-bellied Marmot", "Western Tiger Salamander"),
        # selected = sets which are selected by default
        selected = c("Elk", "Yellow-bellied Marmot", "Western Tiger Salamander")
      ),
      
      # Input: Filter points by observation type
      checkboxGroupInput(
        inputId = "obs",
        label = "Observation Type",
         choiceNames = list(
          "Human Observation",
          "Preserved Specimen",
          "Machine Observation"
        ),
        choiceValues = list(
          "HUMAN_OBSERVATION",
          "PRESERVED_SPECIMEN",
          "MACHINE_OBSERVATION"
        ),
        selected = c("HUMAN_OBSERVATION",
                     "PRESERVED_SPECIMEN",
                     "MACHINE_OBSERVATION"
        )
      ),
      
      
      # Input: Filter by elevation
      sliderInput(
        inputId = "elevation",
        label = "Elevation",
        min = 1000,
        max = 4500,
        value = c(1000, 4500)
      )
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying output (our map)
    mainPanel(# Output: interactive tmap object
      tmapOutput("map"))
    
  )
  
)
```

With this updated `ui` in the `app.R` script, you can actually **run the app** and see what the interface looks like, there just won't be any outputs or reactivity yet.

### Define the `server`

Now we need to define the server logic (i.e., what R code to run when a user interacts with the application) that draws a map based on the user inputs.

Essentially we can take the tmap code above to create the interactive map, but what's changing now is our `occ` data set, which will be filtered based on the user inputs in the `ui`. When an environmental object changes based on user inputs, we call this a *reactive* object and define it within the `reactive()` function. When you later use that reactive object (for example adding it to a map), you must add `()` to the end of the object name. Finally, to create the map we put the code within `renderTmap()`. Here is the final server code, which you should replace with the template `server <-` code in `app.R`. *Note: be cautious of proper bracket placement in this code, rainbow parentheses come in handy with Shiny apps!*

```{r}
server <- function(input, output){
  
  # Make a reactive object for the occ data by calling inputIDs to extract the values the user chose
  occ_react <- reactive(
    occ %>%
      filter(Species %in% input$species) %>%
      filter(basisOfRecord %in% input$obs) %>%
      filter(elevation >= input$elevation[1] &
               elevation <= input$elevation[2])
  )
  
  # Render the map based on our reactive occurrence dataset
  output$map <- renderTmap({
    tm_shape(occ_react()) +
      tm_dots(
        col = "Species",
        size = 0.1,
        palette = "Dark2",
        title = "Species Occurrences",
        popup.vars = c(
          "Species" = "Species",
          "Record Type" = "basisOfRecord",
          "Elevation (m)" = "elevation"
        )
      ) +
      tm_shape(ROMO) +
      tm_polygons(alpha = 0.7, title = "Rocky Mountain National Park")
    
    
  })
  
  
  
}
```

### Sharing your application

To share Shiny applications you can either share the shiny app folder you created (which has the bundled `app.R` file and any associated data files) and the user can run it in their own R session, or you can publicly host your application for free through accounts like [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

Follow [this tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html) for creating a free shinyapps.io account and deploying your shiny application.

### Further exploration

This was a very basic example of a shiny application. There are a huge range of layouts, widgets, and outputs to explore in Shiny. Some places to get started are the Shiny [cheat sheet](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf) and the Shiny [gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) (which includes links to the raw code that built the application).
